My C study place...  
I haven't coded in C for 20 years @_@  
Forgot sooo much about C and C++... So, I decided to reshape my skills

* First, Check gcc is installed.  usually it is. If not, install gcc
* locate glibc to make sure library is installed.
* if you have any questions, you can do man gcc to get more info on gcc
